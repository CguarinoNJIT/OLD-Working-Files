# Project 1 
## Automated Unit Test 

### Objectives: 
- Build a calculator in Python using OOP and TDD. Pay attention to SOLID principles.  
- Use the "unittest" library to automate the evaluation of the different calculator static methods. 
- Have the program run inside a Docker Container. 

### Description: 
#### CsvReader.py - This will read the csv test files and format them to be used in the Unit Tests. 
#### Calculator.py - Where all of the arithmetic classes are as well as the Calculator class. 
#### CalculatorTests.py - This is where the Unit Tests take place. The program runs 7 unit tests. It tests instantiation of the Calculator class, confirms an initialized result value of 0, and confirms that all of the 5 mathematical calculations work.
