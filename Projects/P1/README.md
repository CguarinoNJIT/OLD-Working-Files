# Project 1 
##Automated Unit Test 

###Objectives: 
- Build a calculator in Python using OOP and TDD. Pay attention to SOLID principles.  
- Use the "unittest" library to automate the evaluation of the different calculator static methods. 
- Have the program run inside a Docker Container. 

###Description: 
####CsvReader.py - This will read the csv test files and format them to be used in the Unit Tests. 
####Calculator.py - Where all of the arithmetic classes are as well as the Calculator class. 
####CalculatorTests.py - This is where the Unit Tests take place. The program runs 7 unit tests. It tests instantiation of the Calculator class, confirms an initialized result value of 0, and confirms that all of the 5 mathematical calculations work.
