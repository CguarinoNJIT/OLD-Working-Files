## 1947 (Not sure)
* The Cold War begins. Tensions between the USA and the Soviet Union reach a new high. The threat of Nuclear 
## 1962 - J.C.R. Licklider 
* J.C.R. Licklider theorized in his seminal paper about the symbiotic relation that would grow between humans and computers. Licklider outlined the need for a seamless interaction between humans and computers. Licklider is considered a pioneer of articial intelligence. 
* Licklider went on to contribute to early research efforts into the world of networking. In fact he is credited with formulating the earliest ideas of a global computer network at Bolt,Beranek and Newman Inc.(BBN,Tech R&D). Discussed in numerous memos at BBN Licklider proposed the concept of an Intergalactic Computer Network that outlines essentially what our Internet has become today. 
* His work and funding served as the inspiration and foothold for many other Netowrking pioneers. 
## 1968 - The Computer as a Commuinication Device 
* "Creative, interactive communication requires a plastic or moldable medium that can be modeled, a dynamic medium in which premises will flow into consequences, and above all a common medium that can be contributed to and experimented with by all."
* This futurist paper written by J.C.R. Licklider and Robert W. Taylor illustrates how the leap from commonplace telecommunications to a more sophisticated network of multiaccess computers would dramatically improve creative comminication and problem solving. 
  * Proposing the idea that a network of computers would mean amplified human intelligence. An extension and supplimentation of the mind. 
  * This paper theorizes about the types of communities that can grow out of a networked system of general purpose computers. Introductions, discusions, and parting all happening on-line. 
    * "First, life will be happier for the on-line individual because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity. Second, communication will be more effective and productive, and therefore more enjoyable. Third, much communication and interaction will be with programs and programmed models, which will be (a) highly responsive, (b) supplementary to one’s own capabilities, rather than competitive, and (c) capable of representing progressively more complex ideas without necessarily displaying all the levels of their structure at the same time-and which will therefore be both challenging and rewarding. And, fourth, there will be plenty of opportunity for everyone (who can afford a console) to find his calling, for the whole world of information, with all its fields and disciplines, will be open to him—with programs ready to guide him or to help him explore."

## 1965 - MIT Lincoln Lab Experiment 
* Lawrence G. Roberts and Thomas Marill connected a TX-2 at MIT Lincoln Lab to a Q-32 at System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, Califorina using a telephone line on lease from Western Union. 
  * Head of APRA's Informaiton Processing Techniques Office(IPTO), Ivan Sutherland, decided it was time that research was put into the complications with interconnecting computers. 
  * Sutherland gave the project to Larence G. Roberts who then contracted Thomas Marill, former student of Licklider and the founder of the time-sharing company Computer Corporation of America. 
* These early computer network utilized Curcuit Switching tehnology. This was the standard switching technology that the phone companies used at this time. 
* This was a slow and laborious process of having to have a deicated connection between the two interfacing computers. Not at all suitable for computer communication that takes seconds to terminate. 
## 1962 - Paul Baran: On Distributed Communications Networks 
* Paul Baran was a researcher at RAND Corporation that was in joint research with the US Airforce. Baran proposed a program to solve the comunications vaunurability that exsisted in event of a nuclear attack on US soil. The issue being that all military stratigic command and communications relied on the standard Curcuit Switching network of telephone lines. The system is Centralized, so in the occurance of a few well attacks the US military's communications would be disabled. 
* Baran proposed a "Fish-Net" like network that utilized a store-and-forward message switching system in which each node or communication device of the network would treat a message, in it's entirety, like a "hot-potato" and continually attempt to pass it on to the next available node. Due to the "Fish-Net" structure of the network each node would have nurmerous routes to pass the message along by choosing alternate routes if it's prefered route is overwhelmed or disconnected.  
## 1966 - Donald Davies: Packet Switching
* Davies proposed that if you had high data rates and short messages  the storage time delay that was present with Message Switching could be avoided. 
* A message block for instance would be parsed up into "packets" and then distributed throughout the Distributed Network. 
* Each packet would find it's own unique way to it's destination based on node conditions and traffic. Once arriving at it's destination the packets would be reassembled into the message. 
* At this time however packet swithcing within a distributed network was riddled with dozens of exicution delimeas. One of the major road-blocks being that a newtork for this to operate within did not exist and would not for another 22 years.
