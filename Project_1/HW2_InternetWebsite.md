## 1965 - MIT Lincoln Lab Experiment 
* Lawrence G. Roberts and Thomas Marill connected a TX-2 at MIT Lincoln Lab to a Q-32 at System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, Califorina using a telephone line on lease from Western Union. 
  * Head of APRA's Informaiton Processing Techniques Office(IPTO), Ivan Sutherland, decided it was time that research was put into the complications with interconnecting computers. 
  * Sutherland gave the project to Larence G. Roberts who then contracted Thomas Marill, former student of Licklider and the founder of the time-sharing company Computer Corporation of America. 
* These early computer network utilized Curcuit Switching tehnology. This was the standard switching technology that the phone companies used at this time. 
* This was a slow and laborious process of having to have a deicated connection between the two interfacing computers. Not at all suitable for computer communication that takes seconds to terminate. 
## 1962 - Paul Baran: On Distributed Communications Networks 
* Paul Baran was a researcher at RAND Corporation that was in joint research with the US Airforce. Baran proposed a program to solve the comunications vaunurability that exsisted in event of a nuclear attack on US soil. The issue being that all military stratigic command and communications relied on the standard Curcuit Switching network of telephone lines. The system is Centralized, so in the occurance of a few well attacks the US military's communications would be disabled. 
* Baran proposed a "Fish-Net" like network that utilized a store-and-forward message switching system in which each node or communication device of the network would treat a message, in it's entirety, like a "hot-potato" and continually attempt to pass it on to the next available node. Due to the "Fish-Net" structure of the network each node would have nurmerous routes to pass the message along by choosing alternate routes if it's prefered route is overwhelmed or disconnected.  
## 1966 - Donald Davies: Packet Switching
* Davies proposed that if you had high data rates and short messages  the storage time delay that was present with Message Switching could be avoided. 
* A message block for instance would be parsed up into "packets" and then distributed throughout the Distributed Network. 
* Each packet would find it's own unique way to it's destination based on node conditions and traffic. Once arriving at it's destination the packets would be reassembled into the message. 
* At this time however packet swithcing within a distributed network was riddled with dozens of exicution delimeas. One of the major road-blocks being that a newtork for this to operate within did not exist and would not for another 22 years.
