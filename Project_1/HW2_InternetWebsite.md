# Beginnings 
## 1947 (Not sure)
* The Cold War begins. Tensions between the USA and the Soviet Union reach a new high. The threat of Nuclear 
## 1962 - J.C.R. Licklider 
* J.C.R. Licklider theorized in his seminal paper about the symbiotic relation that would grow between humans and computers. Licklider outlined the need for a seamless interaction between humans and computers. Licklider is considered a pioneer of articial intelligence. 
* Licklider went on to contribute to early research efforts into the world of networking. In fact he is credited with formulating the earliest ideas of a global computer network at Bolt,Beranek and Newman Inc.(BBN,Tech R&D). Discussed in numerous memos at BBN Licklider proposed the concept of an Intergalactic Computer Network that outlines essentially what our Internet has become today. 
* His work and funding served as the inspiration and foothold for many other Netowrking pioneers. 
## 1968 - The Computer as a Commuinication Device 
* "Creative, interactive communication requires a plastic or moldable medium that can be modeled, a dynamic medium in which premises will flow into consequences, and above all a common medium that can be contributed to and experimented with by all."
* This futurist paper written by J.C.R. Licklider and Robert W. Taylor illustrates how the leap from commonplace telecommunications to a more sophisticated network of multiaccess computers would dramatically improve creative comminication and problem solving. 
  * Proposing the idea that a network of computers would mean amplified human intelligence. An extension and supplimentation of the mind. 
  * This paper theorizes about the types of communities that can grow out of a networked system of general purpose computers. Introductions, discusions, and parting all happening on-line. 
    * "First, life will be happier for the on-line individual because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity. Second, communication will be more effective and productive, and therefore more enjoyable. Third, much communication and interaction will be with programs and programmed models, which will be (a) highly responsive, (b) supplementary to one’s own capabilities, rather than competitive, and (c) capable of representing progressively more complex ideas without necessarily displaying all the levels of their structure at the same time-and which will therefore be both challenging and rewarding. And, fourth, there will be plenty of opportunity for everyone (who can afford a console) to find his calling, for the whole world of information, with all its fields and disciplines, will be open to him—with programs ready to guide him or to help him explore."
